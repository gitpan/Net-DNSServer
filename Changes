Revision history for Perl extension Net::DNSServer.

0.07  Mon Apr 08 01:00:00 2002
  - Implement timeout feature for Proxy resolver
    to account for UDP packet loss.
  - Fix --port and --Pidfile feature.
  - Add a few more tests and demos.

0.06  Thu Jun 28 23:28:00 2001
  - Combined hashes into one for Cache
  - Actually do locking for DBMCache to avoid corruption
  - Proxy automatically defaults from /etc/resolv.conf

0.05  Mon May 28 21:00:00 2001
  - Renamed MemCache.pm to SharedCache.pm to avoid confusion
    between Cache.pm (which is in memory) and also to be
    more consistent with IPC::SharedCache, which is how
    I implemented it.
  - Pass the response packet to the post() method of
    the resolver to allow fixup style manipulation of
    the response similar to how Apache works.
  - Got Net::DNSServer::DBMCache working with freeze/thaw
  - Added more perldoc.
