BUILD
-----

To build this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

When you run "perl Makefile.PL", it should complain
if any of the required modules are missing.  Install
those first then try again if you run into trouble.

RPM
---

If you prefer the rpm method instead, use the tarball.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make dist
    rpm -ta Net-DNSServer-*.tar.gz

# rpm -ivh /usr/src/*/RPMS/*/perl-Net-DNSServer-*.rpm
