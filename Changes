0.08  Tue Apr 17 17:00:00 2002
  - Get demo/named.forwader to function again.
  - Fixed "dig" syntax in t/110proxy.t.
  - Moved commandline parsing operations
    from configure_hook() to run() to override
    the Net::Server functionality and allow

0.07  Mon Apr 08 01:00:00 2002

    to account for UDP packet loss.

0.06  Thu Jun 28 23:28:00 2001
  - Combined hashes into one for Cache
  - Actually do locking for DBMCache to avoid corruption
  - Proxy automatically defaults from /etc/resolv.conf

0.05  Mon May 28 21:00:00 2001
  - Renamed MemCache.pm to SharedCache.pm to avoid confusion
    between Cache.pm (which is in memory) and also to be
    more consistent with IPC::SharedCache, which is how
    I implemented it.
  - Pass the response packet to the post() method of
    the resolver to allow fixup style manipulation of
    the response similar to how Apache works.
  - Got Net::DNSServer::DBMCache working with freeze/thaw
  - Added more perldoc.

  - Test suite within t/*.t
  - Remove dependencies from my internal (non-CPAN) modules.
  - Fixed some (root) caching bugs.
  - Makefile.PL PREREQ_PM settings.
  - Changed run() input syntax back to the old way.
