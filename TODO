Functions and Features that still need to be implemented:

MORE DOCUMENTATION
 - Perldocs
 - Example usage
Test suite
Recursive queries (Net::DNSServer::Recursion)
TCP connections Xfer/Proxy
Secondary/Slaving of zones
Handle Dynamic Updates?

The following need to be done before Alpha Release:

Hint zone support
Main configuration file parsing
 - Compatible with bind, but more options
 - Do the work of feeding into options and zone referenes
 - Values of {} should return array ref
Zone configuration file parsing
 - Compatible with bind
 - Use ";" as comments
 - Handle $TTL, $ORIGIN, etc
 - Zone "Templating" support
Probably just utilize an external parsing
module like one or more of the following:
 - DNS::ZoneParse
 - DNS::ZoneFile
 - Net::DNS::ZoneFile
 - Net::Bind
 - BIND::Conf_Parser
No weird hard coded files or at least better defaults.
